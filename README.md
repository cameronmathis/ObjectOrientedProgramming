## General info
This is a project I did in order to practice implementing object oriented progamming concepts. In order to run each individual concept, you can use the command:

	$ ./run.sh [Concept]

Where the concept is one word with the first letter capitalized. (EX: $ ./run.sh Abstraction)

## Concepts

### Abstraction
Abstraction is the concept of object-oriented programming that “shows” only essential attributes and “hides” unnecessary information. The main purpose of abstraction is hiding the unnecessary details from the users.

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation is one of the fundamentals of OOP (object-oriented programming). It refers to the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data. Encapsulation is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class, preventing unauthorized parties’ direct access to them.

### Inheritance
Inheritance is the mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object or class, retaining similar implementation.

### Polymorphism
Polymorphism is the method that performs different things as per the object's class, which calls it. With Polymorphism, a message is sent to multiple class objects, and every object responds appropriately according to the properties of the class.
